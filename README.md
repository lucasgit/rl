# PGQ

This repository contains an implementation of the [PGQ algorithm](https://ewrl.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/ewrl13-2016-submission_24.pdf) and other temporal-difference learning algorithms in Python.

On Ubuntu 16.04, install git with
	
	sudo apt-get install git

and clone the repository with

	git clone https://github.com/lucasgit/rl.git
	cd rl/TD/src

To run this code, Python 2.7, numpy, and scipy need to be installed. Run the following to install them:

	sudo apt-get install python2.7 python-numpy python-scipy 

To also enable plotting with Latex support, install

	sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib textlive-latex-extra dvipng

The plots for the NIPS 2016 submission can be generated by running

	python plots_nips2016.py

Every experiment is implemented as a separate script. For info on how to launch them, run

	python baird.py -h
	python mountaincar.py -h
	python acrobot.py -h

To perform gridsearch use [experiment-manager](https://github.com/lucasgit/experiment-manager.git). Currently experiment-manager only supports launching jobs over the bash shell (not over PBS or other systems).
